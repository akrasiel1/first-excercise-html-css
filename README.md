#### In this exercise, I put in practice what I've learnt so far, using HTML and simple CSS styling properties.

#### This is an introductory webpage  with a navigation menu, arranged horizontally using inline-block property and floated on the right side.
#### The background is a sunset image which takes the entirety of the viewport, with opacity set at 0.9
#### The hover effect on the nav menu is achieved using transition property, 'ease-in-out' with a speed of 0.15s

#### There is a centered section displaying my name and what I'm trying to achieve.
